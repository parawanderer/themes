# Themes 

A bunch of OneDark theme edits that look like each other across editors. One of the things that bothered me a lot is that across OneDark themes available for IntelliJ (or derived editors like Android Studio)/VSCode/Visual Studio there were inconsistencies between how some things/concepts were highlighted between languages. This repo contains edits that align these things across all 3 of these.
